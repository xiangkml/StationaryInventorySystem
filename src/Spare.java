/*  Assumption

 1. when add new product, all warehouse will automatically add the product but the quantity will be zero
 2. all product import from supplier will store in main warehouse which is KL warehouse
 3. other branches will import the stock from the main warehouse
 4. when user add new supplier and product supplied, must add the product first
 5. same things apply to goods receives
 6. all branch can only perform the stock transfer and stock return between main warehouse and itself
 7. reorder level must at least 5
